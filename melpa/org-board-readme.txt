org-board uses `org-attach' and `wget' to provide a bookmarking and
web archival system directly from an Org file.  Any `wget' switch
can be used in `org-board', and presets (like user agents) can be
used for easier control.  Every snapshot is logged, and snapshots
for the same link can be compared using the `ztree' package
(optional dependency).
