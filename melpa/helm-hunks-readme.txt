A helm interface for browsing unstaged git hunks.

Enable `helm-follow-mode' and trigger `helm-hunks' to jump around
unstaged hunks like never before. Stage them with `C-s`.

Run `helm-hunks-current-buffer` to jump around the current buffer only.

Run `helm-hunks-staged` to jump around staged hunks, unstage with `C-u`.

Run `helm-hunks-staged-current-buffer` to jump around staged hunks in
