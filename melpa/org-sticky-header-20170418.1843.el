;;; org-sticky-header.el --- Show off-screen Org heading at top of window -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header
;; Package-Version: 20170418.1843
;; Version: 0.1.0-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (dash "2.13.0") (s "1.10.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org

;;; Commentary:

;; This package displays in the header-line the Org heading for the
;; node that's at the top of the window.  This way, if the heading for
;; the text at the top of the window is beyond the top of the window,
;; you don't forget which heading the text belongs to.

;; The code is very simple and is based on `semantic-stickyfunc-mode'.

;;; Installation:

;; Install from MELPA and run `org-sticky-header-mode'.

;; To install manually, put this file in your `load-path', require
;; `org-sticky-header' in your init file, and run the same command.

;; You probably want to add `org-sticky-func-mode' to your `org-mode-hook'.
