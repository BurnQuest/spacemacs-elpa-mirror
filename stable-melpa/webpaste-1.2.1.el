;;; Commentary:

;; This mode allows to paste whole buffers or parts of buffers to
;; pastebin-like services.  It supports more than one service and will
;; failover if one service fails.  More services can easily be added
;; over time and prefered services can easily be configured.

:uri            URI that we should do the request to to paste data.
:type           HTTP Request type, defaults to POST.
:parser         Defines how request.el parses the result. Look up :parser for
                `request'. This defaults to 'buffer-string.
:post-data      Default post fields sent to service. Defaults to nil.
:post-field     Name of the field to insert the code into.
:sync           Set to t to wait until request is done.  Defaults to nil.  This
                should only be used for debugging purposes.
:success-lambda Callback sent to `request', look up how to write these in the
                documentation for `request'.
:error-lambda   Callback sent to `request', look up how to write these in the
                documentation for `request'.  A good default value forr this is
                `webpaste/providers-error-lambda', but there's also
                `webpaste/providers-error-lambda-no-failover' available if you
                need a provider that isn't allowed to failover."
