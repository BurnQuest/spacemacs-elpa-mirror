mentor is a GNU Emacs frontend for the `rTorrent' bittorrent client.  It uses
XML-RPC to communicate with rTorrent, and needs rTorrent to be configured
accordingly.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users.  Key bindings are chosen
to be as close to the vanilla rTorrent curses interface as possible.
