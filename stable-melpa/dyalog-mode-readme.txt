Dyalog-mode is a major mode for editing Dyalog APL source code.

It supports basic syntax highlighting and indentation. It relies on regex
hacks for both indentation and syntax highlighting, so it sometimes gets
confused.

If you use ediff to diff Dyalog APL source code, you can set
ediff-forward-word-function to dyalog-ediff-forward-word to get better
diffs.
